# TFG Truffle Pet Shop

This project is a decentralized application (DApp) built with Truffle, Ganache, and Docker Compose. It demonstrates a blockchain-based pet adoption platform. The applicationâ€™s backend is developed using Ethereum smart contracts and deployed locally with Ganache.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js and npm**: These are required if you want to manage dependencies or build the project locally without Docker.

## Project Structure

- `contracts/`: Ethereum smart contracts for the application.
- `migrations/`: Migration scripts to deploy smart contracts.
- `src/`: Frontend code for the DApp.
- `test/`: Tests for the smart contracts.

## Getting Started
